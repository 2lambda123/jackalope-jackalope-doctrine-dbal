# Jackalope [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/jackalope/jackalope-doctrine-dbal.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/jackalope/jackalope-doctrine-dbal)

A powerful implementation of the [PHPCR API](http://phpcr.github.com).

Jackalope binding for relational databases with the DoctrineDBAL. Tested to work
with MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite and has no dependency on java or jackrabbit.
For the moment, it is less feature complete.

# Preconditions

* php >= 5.3
* phpunit >= 3.6 (if you want to run the tests)
* phpunit/DbUnit (if you want to run the Doctrine DBAL Transport tests)
* [composer](http://getcomposer.org/)


# Installation

To install jackalope, run the following in the parent directory of where you want jackalope:

    # get source
    git clone git://github.com/jackalope/jackalope-doctrine-dbal.git
    cd jackalope-doctrine-dbal

    # install dependencies
    curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php
    php composer.phar install

    # install tests dependencies
    php composer.phar install --dev

Note that the --dev parameter is only needed if you want to be able to run the test suite.

## Create a repository

Set up a new database supported by Doctrine DBAL. You can use your favorite GUI frontend or just do something like this:

### MySQL
    mysqladmin -u root -p  create jackalope
    echo "grant all privileges on jackalope.* to 'jackalope'@'localhost' identified by '1234test'; flush privileges;" | mysql -u root -p

### PostgreSQL
    psql -c "CREATE ROLE jackalope WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD '1234test' NOINHERIT LOGIN;" -U postgres
    psql -c "CREATE DATABASE jackalope WITH OWNER = jackalope;" -U postgres

### SQLite
    Database is created automagically if you specify driver and path ("pdo_sqlite", "jackalope.db"). Databasename is not needed.

## phpunit Tests

If you want to run the tests, please see the [README file in the tests folder](https://github.com/jackalope/jackalope-doctrine-dbal/blob/master/tests/README.md)
and check if you told composer to install the suggested dependencies (see Installation).


## Enable the commands

There are a couple of useful commands to interact with the repository.

To use the console, copy ``cli-config.php.dist`` to ``cli-config.php`` and configure
the connection parameters.
Then you can run the commands from the jackalope directory with ``./bin/jackalope``

NOTE: If you are using PHPCR inside of **Symfony**, the DoctrinePHPCRBundle
provides the commands inside the normal Symfony console and you don't need to
prepare anything special.

Jackalope specific commands:

* ``jackalope:init:dbal``: Initialize the configured database for jackalope with the
    Doctrine DBAL transport.

Commands available from the phpcr-utils:

* ``phpcr:workspace:create <name>``: Create a workspace *name* in the repository
* ``phpcr:register-node-types --allow-update [cnd-file]``: Register namespaces
    and node types from a "Compact Node Type Definition" .cnd file
* ``phpcr:dump [--sys_nodes[="..."]] [--props[="..."]] [path]``: Show the node
    names under the specified path. If you set sys_nodes=yes you will also see
    system nodes. If you set props=yes you will additionally see all properties
    of the dumped nodes.
* ``phpcr:purge``: Remove all content from the configured repository in the
     configured workspace
* ``phpcr:sql2``: Run a query in the JCR SQL2 language against the repository
    and dump the resulting rows to the console.



# Bootstrapping

Jackalope relies on autoloading. Namespaces and folders are compliant with
PSR-0. You should use the autoload file generated by composer:
``vendor/autoload.php``

If you want to integrate jackalope into other PSR-0 compliant code and use your
own classloader, find the mapping in ``vendor/composer/autoload_namespaces.php``

Before you can use jackalope with a database, you need to set the database up.
Create a database as described above, then make sure the command line utility
is set up (see above "Enable the commands"). Now you can run:

    bin/jackalope jackalope:init:dbal

Once these steps are done, you can bootstrap the library. A minimalist
sample code to get a PHPCR session with the doctrine-dbal backend:

    $driver    = 'pdo_mysql'; // pdo_pgsql | pdo_sqlite
    $host      = 'localhost';
    $user      = 'jackalope';
    $password  = '';
    $database  = 'jackalope'; // $path = 'jackalope.db'; // for SQLite
    $workspace = 'default';

    // Bootstrap Doctrine
    $dbConn = \Doctrine\DBAL\DriverManager::getConnection(array(
        'driver'    => $driver,
        'host'      => $host,
        'user'      => $user,
        'password'  => $pass,
        'dbname'    => $database,
        // 'path'   => $path, // for SQLite
    ));

    $repository = \Jackalope\RepositoryFactoryDoctrineDBAL::getRepository(
        array('jackalope.doctrine_dbal_connection' => $dbConn)
    );
    // dummy credentials to comply with the API
    $credentials = new \PHPCR\SimpleCredentials(null, null);
    $session = $repository->login($credentials, $workspace);

To use a workspace different than ``default`` you need to create it first. The
easiest is to run the command ``bin/jackalope phpcr:workspace:create <myworkspace>``
but you can of course also use the PHPCR API to create workspaces from your code.


# Usage

The entry point is to create the repository factory. The factory specifies the
storage backend as well. From this point on, there are no differences in the
usage (except for supported features, that is).

    // see Bootstrapping for how to get the session.

    $rootNode = $session->getNode("/");
    $whitewashing = $rootNode->addNode("www-whitewashing-de");
    $session->save();

    $posts = $whitewashing->addNode("posts");
    $session->save();

    $post = $posts->addNode("welcome-to-blog");
    $post->addMixin("mix:title");
    $post->setProperty("jcr:title", "Welcome to my Blog!");
    $post->setProperty("jcr:description", "This is the first post on my blog! Do you like it?");

    $session->save();

for a more detailed tutorial on how to use the PHPCR API.


# Implementation notes

See [doc/architecture.md](https://github.com/jackalope/jackalope/blob/master/doc/architecture.md)
for an introduction how Jackalope is built. Have a look at the source files and
generate the phpdoc.


# TODO

The best overview of what needs to be done are the skipped API tests.
Have a look at [DoctrineDBALImplementationLoader](https://github.com/jackalope/jackalope-doctrine-dbal/blob/master/tests/inc/DoctrineDBALImplementationLoader.php)
to see what is currently not working and start hacking :-)


## Some notes

* Refactor storage to implement one one table per database type?
* Optimize database storage more, using real ids and normalizing the uuids and paths?
* Implement parser for Jackrabbit CND syntax for node-type definitions in phpcr-utils.
